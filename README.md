# paperclips-auto

This bit of javascript completes the game Universal Paperclips, unattended. It currently works, but the developers may release updates that will break this code. The javascript code is a rudimentary rules engine that relies on the presence of specific DOM elements and game mechanics. Simple mathematical calculations drive the strategy, which has much room for optimization. A 8px red indicator temporarily appears over the clicked control, so you can visualize what the code is doing. Console messages are emitted for most actions.

The offer will be rejected.
